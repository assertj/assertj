[[soft-assertions]]
= Soft assertions

With soft assertions AssertJ collects all assertion errors instead of stopping at the first one.

TIP: This is especially useful for long tests like end to end tests as we can fix all reported errors at once and avoid multiple failing runs.

Since soft assertions don't fail at the first error, you need to tell AssertJ when to report the captured assertion errors, there are different ways of doing so:

* Calling `assertAll()` (basic approach)
* Using a link:#junit4-soft-assertions[JUnit 4 rule] that takes care of calling `assertAll()` after each tests
* Using the provided link:#junit5-soft-assertions[JUnit 5 extension] which injects a `SoftAssertions` or a `BDDSoftAssertions` parameter and calls `assertAll()` after each tests
* Using a link:#closeable-soft-assertions[`AutoCloseableSoftAssertions`]
* Using link:#assertSoftly-assertions[`assertSoftly` static method]

Soft assertions comes with a link:#bdd-soft-assertions[BDD flavor] where `assertThat` is replaced by `then`.

If you have created your own custom Soft assertions it is possible to link:#soft-assertions-combining[combine them all in a single soft assertions entry point].

Let's see first how to use soft assertions *requiring an explicit call to `assertAll()`*, the other approaches that don't require this explicitit call are described in the subsequent sections.

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$SoftAssertionsExample.java[tags=basic-soft-assertions]
----
<1> Build a `SoftAssertions` instance to record all assertion errors
<2> Use `softly.assertThat` instead of the usual `assertThat` methods
<3> *Don't forget to call `assertAll()` to report all assertion errors!*

The previous test fails with the message below reporting all the errors:

[source, text]
----
Multiple Failures (3 failures)
-- failure 1 --
[great authors]
Expecting:
 <"George Martin">
to be equal to:
 <"JRR Tolkien">
but was not.
-- failure 2 --
[response to Everything]
Expecting:
 \<42>
to be greater than:
 \<100>
-- failure 3 --
Expecting:
 <"gandalf">
to be equal to:
 <"sauron">
but was not.

[[bdd-soft-assertions]]
== BDD Soft assertions

BDD aficionados can use BDD soft assertions where `assertThat` is replaced by `then`.

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$BDDSoftAssertionsExample.java[tags=basic-bdd-soft-assertions]
----

There are BDD soft assertions versions for the different soft assertions approaches:

* `AutoCloseableBDDSoftAssertions`
* Using `JUnitBDDSoftAssertions` that takes care of calling `assertAll()` after each tests
* Using a JUnit 5 extension that takes care of calling `assertAll()` after each tests

[[junit4-soft-assertions]]
== JUnit 4 Soft assertions rule

The JUnit rule provided by AssertJ takes care of calling `assertAll()` at the end of each tests.

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$JUnit4SoftAssertionsExample.java[tags=junit4-soft-assertions]
----

In a similar way you can use `JUnitBDDSoftAssertions`  where `assertThat` is replaced by `then`:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$JUnit4BDDSoftAssertionsExample.java[tags=junit4-bdd-soft-assertions]
----

[[junit5-soft-assertions]]
== JUnit 5 soft assertions extension

`SoftAssertionsExtension` is a JUnit 5 extension that:

* takes care of calling `assertAll()` at the end of each tests
* supports link:#junit5-soft-assertions-field-injection[initializing `SoftAssertionsProvider` field] annotated with `@InjectSoftAssertions`
* supports link:#junit5-soft-assertions-field-parameter[injecting a `SoftAssertionsProvider` parameter] in each test methods

`SoftAssertionsProvider` is the interface that any concrete soft assertions class must implement, AssertJ provides two of them: `SoftAssertions` and `BDDSoftAssertions`, but custom implementations are also supported as long as they have a default constructor. See the end of link:#soft-assertions-combining[combining soft assertions entry points] section for an example.

IMPORTANT: `JUnitJupiterSoftAssertions`, `JUnitJupiterBDDSoftAssertions` and `SoftlyExtension` are now deprecated in favor of `SoftAssertionsExtension`.

[[junit5-soft-assertions-field-injection]]
=== SoftAssertionsProvider field injection

`SoftAssertionsExtension` supports injecting any instance of `SoftAssertionsProvider` into a class test field annotated with `@InjectSoftAssertions`. +
The injection occurs before each test method execution, after each test `assertAll()` is invoked to verify that no soft assertions failed.

A nested test class can provide a `SoftAssertionsProvider` field when it extends this extension or can inherit the parent's one.

You can have multiple soft assertion providers injected into a single test class. Assertions made on any of them will be collected in a single error collector and reported all together, in the same order that they failed.

This extension throws an `ExtensionConfigurationException` if:

* the field is static or final or cannot be accessed;
* the field type is not a concrete implementation of `SoftAssertionsProvider` (or subclass); or
* the field type has no default constructor.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
import org.assertj.core.api.SoftAssertions;
import org.assertj.core.api.junit.jupiter.SoftAssertionsExtension;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Nested;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;

@ExtendWith(SoftAssertionsExtension.class)
public class JUnit5SoftAssertionsExtensionAssertionsExamples {

  @InjectSoftAssertions
  private SoftAssertions softly;

  @Test
  public void chained_soft_assertions_example() {
    String name = "Michael Jordan - Bulls";
    softly.assertThat(name).startsWith("Mi")
                           .contains("Bulls");
    // no need to call softly.assertAll(), this is done by the extension
  }

  // nested classes test work too
  @Nested
  class NestedExample {

    @Test
    public void football_assertions_example() {
      String kylian = "Kylian Mbapp√©";
      softly.assertThat(kylian).startsWith("Ky")
                               .contains("bap");
      // no need to call softly.assertAll(), this is done by the extension
    }
  }
}
----

[[junit5-soft-assertions-parameter-injection]]
=== SoftAssertionsProvider parameter injection

`SoftAssertionsExtension` supports injecting any `SoftAssertionsProvider` implementation as a parameter in any test method.

The term "test method" refers to any method annotated with `@Test`, `@RepeatedTest`, `@ParameterizedTest`, `@TestFactory` or `@TestTemplate`.
Notably, the extension is compatible with link:https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests[parameterized tests], the parameterized arguments must come first and the soft assertions argument last.

The scope of the `SoftAssertionsProvider` instance managed by this extension begins when a parameter of type `SoftAssertionsProvider` is resolved for a test method. +
It ends after the test method has been executed, this is when `assertAll()` will be invoked on the instance to verify that no soft assertions failed.

Parameter injection and field injection can be mixed. Assertions made on the field- and parameter-injected soft assertion providers will all be collected and reported together when the extension calls `assertAll()`.

This extension throws a `ParameterResolutionException` if the resolved `SoftAssertionsProvider` :

* is abstract; or
* has no default constructor.

[[closeable-soft-assertions]]
== Auto Closeable Soft assertions

As `AutoCloseableSoftAssertions` implements `AutoCloseable#close()` by calling `assertAll()`, when used in a try-with-resources block `assertAll()` is called automatically before exiting the block.

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$AutoCloseableSoftAssertionsExample.java[tags=closeable-soft-assertions]
----

In a similar way you can use `AutoCloseableBDDSoftAssertions`  where `assertThat` is replaced by `then`:

----
include::example$AutoCloseableBDDSoftAssertionsExample.java[tags=closeable-bdd-soft-assertions]

[[assertSoftly-assertions]]
== Soft assertions with `assertSoftly`

The `assertSoftly` static method takes care of calling `assertAll()` before exiting.

[[soft-assertions-combining]]
== Combining soft assertions entry points

Since the 3.16.0 version AssertJ provides a way to combine standard soft assertions with custom ones in a single entry point.

Let's assume we have written an entry point for `TolkienCharacter` soft assertions so that we can write assertions like:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
TolkienSoftAssertions softly = new TolkienSoftAssertions();
softly.assertThat(frodo).hasRace(HOBBIT)
                        .hasName("Frodo");
----
If we want to check standard soft assertions we could make `TolkienSoftAssertions` inherit `SoftAssertions` but if we want to have `GoTSoftAssertions` too then we are stuck as Java does not allow multiple inheritance.

The 3.16.0 release introduced the `SoftAssertionsProvider` interface to define soft assertions entry points.

[.underline]#Step 1# +
The first step consists in extending this interface to expose as many custom entry points as you need. +
The typical custom `SoftAssertionsProvider` interface exposes default `assertThat` methods, as shown below:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public interface TolkienSoftAssertionsProvider extends SoftAssertionsProvider {
  // custom assertions
  default TolkienCharacterAssert assertThat(TolkienCharacter actual) {
    return proxy(TolkienCharacterAssert.class, TolkienCharacter.class, actual);
  }
}

// let's add a Game of Thrones entry point
public interface GoTSoftAssertionsProvider extends SoftAssertionsProvider {
  // custom assertions
  default GoTCharacterAssert assertThat(GoTCharacter actual) {
    return proxy(GoTCharacterAssert.class, GoTCharacter.class, actual);
  }
}
----

[.underline]#Step 2# +
In order to get a concrete entry point exposing all custom entry points, create a class implementing all custom `SoftAssertionsProvider` subinterfaces and extending `AbstractSoftAssertions`.
`AbstractSoftAssertions` provides the core internal implementation to collect all errors from the different implemented entry points (it also implements `SoftAssertionsProvider`).

To get standard soft assertions, inherit from `SoftAssertions` instead of `AbstractSoftAssertions` (or `BddSoftAssertions` to get the BDD flavor).

Let's define our concrete entry points implementing both `TolkienSoftAssertionsProvider` and `GoTSoftAssertionsProvider`:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// we extend SoftAssertions to get standard soft assertions
public class FantasySoftAssertions extends SoftAssertions
                                   implements TolkienSoftAssertionsProvider, GoTSoftAssertionsProvider {

  // we can even add more assertions here
  public HumanAssert assertThat(Human actual) {
    return proxy(HumanAssert.class, Human.class, actual);
  }
}
----

[.underline]#Step 3# +
The last step is to use `FantasySoftAssertions`:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
FantasySoftAssertions softly = new FantasySoftAssertions();

// custom TolkienCharacter assertions
softly.assertThat(frodo).hasRace(HOBBIT);

// custom GoTCharacter assertions
softly.assertThat(nedStark).isDead();

// standard assertions
softly.assertThat("Games of Thrones").startsWith("Games")
                                     .endsWith("Thrones");
// verify assertions
softly.assertAll();
----

[.underline]#Optional step: create a custom JUnit 4 `Rule`# +

Because our custom assertions are defined in an interface, we can also combine them with AssertJ's
JUnit 4 rule so that we can use our custom assertions as a test rule for use in JUnit 4:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// we extend JUnitSoftAssertions to get standard soft assertions classes
public class JUnitFantasySoftAssertions extends JUnitSoftAssertions
                                   implements TolkienSoftAssertionsProvider, GoTSoftAssertionsProvider {}
----
Then in our test class we use it per normal:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class JUnit4_StandardAndCustomSoftAssertionsExamples {
  @Rule
  public final JUnitFantasySoftAssertions softly = new JUnitFantasySoftAssertions();

  @Test
  public void successful_junit_soft_custom_assertion_example() {
    softly.assertThat(frodo).hasName("Frodo")
                            .hasAge(33);
    softly.assertThat(frodo.age).isEqualTo(33);
  }
}
----

The rule will automatically take care of calling `assertAll()` at the end of every test.


[[junit5-parameter-soft-assertions-custom-injection]]
[.underline]#Optional step: use `SoftAssertionsExtension`# +

JUnit 5 `SoftAssertionsExtension` calls `softly.assertAll()` after each test so that we don't have to do it manually. +
Since 3.16.0 it is capable of injecting any `SoftAssertionsProvider`, we can then inject our custom `FantasySoftAssertions`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@ExtendWith(SoftAssertionsExtension.class)
public class JUnit5_StandardAndCustomSoftAssertionsExamples {

  @Test
  public void successful_junit_soft_custom_assertion_example(FantasySoftAssertions softly) {
    softly.assertThat(frodo).hasName("Frodo")
                            .hasAge(33);
    softly.assertThat(frodo.age).isEqualTo(33);
  }
}
----

[[soft-assertions-collect-listener]]
== Reacting to collected soft assertions

AssertJ allows to perform an action after an `AssertionError` is collected.

The action is specified by the `AfterAssertionErrorCollected` functional interface which can be expressed as lambda, to register your callback call `setAfterAssertionErrorCollected` as shown below:

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
SoftAssertions softly = new SoftAssertions();
StringBuilder reportBuilder = new StringBuilder(format("Assertions report:%n"));

// register our callback
softly.setAfterAssertionErrorCollected(error -> reportBuilder.append(format("------------------%n%s%n", error.getMessage())));
// the AssertionError corresponding to the failing assertions are registered in the report
softly.assertThat("The Beatles").isEqualTo("The Rolling Stones");
softly.assertThat(123).isEqualTo(123)
                      .isEqualTo(456);
----
resulting `reportBuilder`:
[source,text]
----
Assertions report:
------------------
Expecting:
 <"The Beatles">
to be equal to:
 <"The Rolling Stones">
but was not.
------------------
Expecting:
 \<123>
to be equal to:
 \<456>
but was not.
----


Alternatively, if you have defined your own `SoftAssertions` class and inherited from `AbstractSoftAssertions`, you can instead override `onAssertionErrorCollected(AssertionError)`.

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
class TolkienSoftAssertions extends AbstractSoftAssertions {

  public TolkienHeroesAssert assertThat(TolkienHero actual) {
    return proxy(TolkienHeroesAssert.class, TolkienHero.class, actual);
  }

  @Override
  public void onAssertionErrorCollected(AssertionError assertionError) {
    System.out.println(assertionError);
  }
}

TolkienSoftAssertions softly = new TolkienSoftAssertions();

TolkienCharacter frodo = TolkienCharacter.of("Frodo", 33, HOBBIT);

// the AssertionError corresponding to this failing assertion is printed to the console.
softly.assertThat(frodo).hasName("Bilbo");
----
