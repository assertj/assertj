= A simple example

Let's start with a simple example showing a few important things.

[source,java]
----
include::example$SimpleAssertionsExample.java[tags=user_guide]
----
<1> Statically import `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat`
<2> Pass the object under test as the sole `assertThat()` parameter
<3> Use code completion to discover and call assertions
<4> Chain as many assertions as you need

Except for `isNotNull` which is a base assertion, the other assertions are `String` specific as our object under test is a `String`.
