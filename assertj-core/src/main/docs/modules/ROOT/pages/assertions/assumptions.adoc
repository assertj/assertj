= Assumptions

Assumptions provide support for conditional test execution, if the assumptions are met the test is executed normally, if they don't the test is aborted and marked as ignored.

Assumptions are typically used whenever it does not make sense to continue execution of a given test method â€” a typical usage is running tests depending on a given OS/environment.

All AssertJ assumptions are static methods in the `Assumptions` class, they match the assertion API but are names `assumeThat` instead of `assertThat`.
You can also get assumptions through the `WithAssumptions` interface.

Example resulting in the test to be ignored:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$AssumptionsDemo.java[tags=assumption_not_met]
----

Example resulting in the test to be executed normally:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$AssumptionsDemo.java[tags=assumption_met]
