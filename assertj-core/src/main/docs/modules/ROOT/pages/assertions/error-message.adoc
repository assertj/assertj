[[overriding-error-message]]
= Overriding error message

AssertJ tries its best to give helpful error messages, but you can always change it with `overridingErrorMessage()` or `withFailMessage()`.

Example with this failing test:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$OverridingErrorMessageExample.java[tags=user_guide]
----

The error message is:

[source, text]
----
java.lang.AssertionError: should be TolkienCharacter [name=Frodo, age=33, race=HOBBIT]
----

[[lazy-error-message]]
== Lazy error message overriding

If the error message is expensive to build, use the overloaded methods taking a `Supplier<String>` instead of a `String`, the message will only be built if the assertion fails.

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
assertThat(player.isRookie()).overridingErrorMessage(() -> "Expecting Player to be a rookie but was not.")
                             .isTrue();

assertThat(player.isRookie()).withFailMessage(() -> "Expecting Player to be a rookie but was not.")
                             .isTrue();
----
