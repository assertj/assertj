/**
 * Same as {@link SoftAssertions}, but with the following differences: <br>
 * First, it's a junit rule, which can be used without having to call {@link SoftAssertions#assertAll() assertAll()},
 * example:
 * <pre><code class='java'> public class SoftlyTest {
 *
 *     &#064;Rule
 *     public final JUnitBDDSoftAssertions softly = new JUnitBDDSoftAssertions();
 *
 *     &#064;Test
 *     public void soft_bdd_assertions() throws Exception {
 *       softly.then(1).isEqualTo(2);
 *       softly.then(Lists.newArrayList(1, 2)).containsOnly(1, 2);
 *     }
 *  }</code></pre>
 *
 * Second, the failures are recognized by IDE's (like IntelliJ IDEA) which open a comparison window.
