   * Assert that the actual object is equal to the given one by comparing actual's properties/fields with other's

   * It means that if an actual field is not null and the corresponding field in other is null, this field will be
   * ignored in comparison, but the opposite will make assertion fail (null field in actual, not null in other) as 
   * the field is used in the performed comparison and the values differ.
   * <p/>
   * Note that comparison is <b>not</b> recursive, if one of the field is an Object, it will be compared to the other
   * field using its <code>equals</code> method.

   * If an object has a field and a property with the same name, the property value will be used over the field.

   * for example if actual object has a name String field, it is expected other object to also have one.

   * assertThat(mysteriousHobbit).isEqualToIgnoringNullFields(frodo); // FAIL</code></pre>
