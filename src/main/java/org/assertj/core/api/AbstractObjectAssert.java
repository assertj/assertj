   * Assert that the actual object is equal to the given one by comparing actual's fields with <b>not null</b> other's

   * <p/>
   * It means that if an actual field is not null and the corresponding field in other is null, this field will be
   * ignored in comparison, but the opposite will make assertion fail (null field in actual, not null in other).
   * <p/>

   * field using its <code>equals</code> method.
   * <p/>
   * Private fields are used in comparison but this can be disabled using
