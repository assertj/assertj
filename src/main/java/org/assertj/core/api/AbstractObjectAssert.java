   * Assert that the actual object is equal to the given one by comparing actual's properties/fields with other's
   * <b>not null</b> properties/fields only (including inherited ones).
   * <p/>
   * It means that if an actual field is not null and the corresponding field in other is null, this field will be
   * ignored in comparison, but the opposite will make assertion fail (null field in actual, not null in other) as 
   * the field is used in the performed comparison and the values differ.
   * <p/>
   * Note that comparison is <b>not</b> recursive, if one of the field is an Object, it will be compared to the other
   * field using its <code>equals</code> method.
   * <p/>
   * If an object has a field and a property with the same name, the property value will be used over the field.
   * <p/>

   * compared, accessible fields include directly accessible fields (e.g. public) or fields with an accessible getter.
   * <p/>
   * The objects to compare can be of different types but the properties/fields used in comparison must exist in both, 
   * for example if actual object has a name String field, it is expected other object to also have one.

   * Example:
   * <pre><code class='java'> TolkienCharacter frodo = new TolkienCharacter("Frodo", 33, HOBBIT);

   * assertThat(frodo).isEqualToIgnoringNullFields(mysteriousHobbit); // OK
   * 
   * // ... but the lenient equality is not reversible !
   * assertThat(mysteriousHobbit).isEqualToIgnoringNullFields(frodo); // FAIL</code></pre>
   * 
   * @param other the object to compare {@code actual} to.
   * @throws NullPointerException if the actual or other object is {@code null}.
   * @throws AssertionError if the actual and the given object are not lenient equals.
   * @throws IntrospectionError if one of actual's field to compare can't be found in the other object.
