    // this leads to a MissingFormatArgumentException if diffs contains a format specifier (like %s) because the String
    // will finally be evaluated with String.format
    //
    // case 2 - add as format arg to the String passed in super :
    // super("file:<%s> and file:<%s> do not have equal content:"actual, expected, diffs);
    // this is better than case 1 but the diffs String will be quoted before the class to String.format as all String in
    // AssertJ error message. This is not what we want.

    // The solution is to keep diffs as an attribute and append it after String.format has been applied on the error
    // message.
